<!-- No command/output needed. -->

### 2: Initialize a Git repository, and commit your first files

<!-- No command/output needed here -- we check the repo directly. -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part B: A TrimGalore script --- without genAI

<!-- Reminder: no genAI in this Part! -->

*Answer*: The container link (URI) is:

Code to run `trim_galore --help` with the container:

```

<!-- You don't need to paste the TrimGalore help output -->

*Answer*: The option to indicate that the reads are paired-end:

*Answer*: The option to set the output dir:

*Answer*: The option to run FastQC on the trimmed FASTQ files:

### 4: Default thresholds

*Answer*: A) The default base quality score threshold:

*Answer*: B) The default read length threshold:

### 5: Write the `trimgalore.sh` script

<!-- No need to paste the script: we'll look at scripts/trimgalore.sh directly. -->

### 6: Run the script for sample `S63`, and check the output files

Code to run the script:

```bash
# Your command:
```

<!-- You don't need to paste the TrimGalore logging output -->

Code to list the output files:

```bash
# Your command:
```

The output of the command was:

```
```

*Answer*: What each type of output file contains:

<!-- If your script failed at first: describe the problem and your fix here. -->

### 7: Trimming results

*Answer*: Which adapter sequence TrimGalore looked for, and how it decided on this:

*Answer*: Percentage of reads with adapters in R1 and R2:

*Answer*: In R1 and R2, were more bases removed by quality trimming or by adapter trimming?

*Answer*: Percentage of read pairs that were removed:

### 8: Poly-G trimming

*Answer*: Did TrimGalore do poly-G trimming, and did you have to tell it to?

*Answer*: What TrimGalore concludes about the sequencing technology:

*Answer*: Was more poly-G trimming done in R1 or R2? (Optional: any idea why?)

### 9: Compare the FastQC reports before and after trimming

*Answer*: At least two differences between the reports,
and whether things look better in terms of pass/warn/fail status:

*Answer*: Were the short reads with only `N`s removed?
If so, was that due to the length threshold, or something else?

*Answer*: Something you didn't expect or are confused about:
