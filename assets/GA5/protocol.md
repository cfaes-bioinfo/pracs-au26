# RNA-seq analysis of _Culex pipiens_

- This was run at the <???> cluster of the Ohio Supercomputer Center (<https://www.osc.edu>)
- OSC working dir: <???>
- GitHub repository: <???>

## Prerequisites

- **Input files**:
  - Paired-end RNA-seq reads are in `../garrigos/fastq`

- **Software**:
  - The scripts run programs using Apptainer containers,
    with links contained inside the scripts.
  - If running at OSC, no software installations are needed.
  - If you're not at OSC, you need to have Apptainer and Slurm installed.

- Run all code from the working dir listed above.
  You don't need to create the output dirs, because the scripts will do so.

- Each script writes a Slurm log file (`slurm-<script>-<jobID>.out`) to the working dir.
  After the jobs of a step have finished, check these logs for errors,
  then move them into a `logs/` dir within that step's output dir.

## Set up: Download the reference transcriptome FASTA file from NCBI

```bash
# Downloaded on <???>
<???>
```

## Set up: Set file paths

```bash
# Inputs:
fastq_dir=<???>
ref_transcripts=<???>

# Base output dir:
outdir=results
```

## Step 1: Read trimming with TrimGalore

<???>

## Step 2: Creating a transcriptome index with Salmon

<???>

## Step 3: Pseudo-alignment and quantification with Salmon

<???>

## Step 4: Summarizing the results of all steps with MultiQC
