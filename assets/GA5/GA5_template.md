GA5 README template.
- Add your answers to each question's section below.
- For each question where we want you to add your commands,
  put the command(s) you ran in the terminal in the corresponding ```bash code block.
- Where we want to see a command's output, there is a plain ``` code block
  right below the command block: paste the output there.
- The code to run each step of the workflow goes in `protocol.md`, not here:
  you don't need to repeat it in this file.
- You don't need to paste the contents of your scripts into this file:
  we will look at the scripts in your `scripts` dir directly
  (so make sure you commit them!).
